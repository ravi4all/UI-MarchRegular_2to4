       Pretty cool! There's a quick introduction to <b>Pandas</b>, but nowhere near what is available. In this series, we're going to be covering more of the basics of <b>pandas</b>, then move on to navigating and working with <u>dataframes</u>. 
       <i>From there, we'll touch a bit more on visualization, input and output with many data formats, basic and intermediate data analysis and operations, merging and combining dataframes, resampling, and much more with a lot of realistic examples.</i>
